    The Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum (TML) aims to give free access to and make searchable every
    known Latin text on music from the late antiquity to the seventeenth century, in multiple editions
    and in transcriptions from original sources. Primarily an aid to musicological research,
    this resource aims also to assist anyone interested in documenting the broader intersections of
    music with the humanities and the sciences within the Western tradition.
</p>
<p>
    This is a simple static site that contains a copy of the TML. The TEI was downloaded from
    the <a href="https://fenyx.me">Fenyx</a> site and then corrected to produce valid TEI. The site
    is built a combination of a custom XSLT for converting the TEI to HTML, and the Hugo static site
    generator for building the website. The Pagefind tool is used to build a client-side search index.

    Scholarly resources should not hide behind anonymity. This site was built by <a href="https://github.com/ahankinson">Andrew Hankinson</a>,
    primarily as a proof-of-concept for a method of preserving and distributing at-risk databases. As a purely static site,
    with no server-side dependencies, there is no complex server infrastructure needed to keep the site running.
</p>
<p>
    Not all functionality of the old site is available. Search, in particular, is very basic. It can be improved
    with some more investment of development time, but I would like to see a demand for this resource before
    embarking on a significant time investment here.

    Contributors are welcome to submit pull requests. An LLM (ChatGPT 5.2) was used to develop the code for this site,
    but it was all reviewed and verified for inclusion.
